    <h1>Journey ovTha Five Tongued Flame</h1>
    <p>
      your studies are not for conversational fluency, so take your time and
      come back whenever the flames beckon you closer
    </p>
    <p>
      the spiral is a staircase, each exercise and each review iz a stepping
      stone lain, follow the blueprint and resist the urge to break the
      alternation sequence
    </p>
    <p>
      you should always select the rightmost language of the five you have
      selected, this ensures that the longest neglected is the first selected
      (resist the urge to “favor” a tongue, let your desire to come back to it
      propel you through the others more quickly to hasten your return)
    </p>
    <p>if you have five hearts, do a new lesson</p>
    <p>if you have 3 or less, do a review (of the next language in order)</p>
    <p>
      if you have 4 you can choose to do either (try a new lesson with only 4
      hearts or try a review)
    </p>
    <p>
      keep in mind a review will always let you finish and thus you can grab a
      screenshot to get credit, a lesson where you run out of hearts before it
      is completed will count, but you will be submitting a screenshot of a
      setback, so we recommend only doing lessons on 5 hearts but trying it on 4
      can be an added challenge with bragging rights (take a before and after
      screenshot?)
    </p>
    <p>
      submit a BEFORE AND AFTER (this may seem tedious but we are preparing you
      for further developments down the road and learning to get into this
      process will make sense as time goes on) screenshot through email with
      your persona affiliation(s) to link that achievement to all personas you
      so desire, your temporal return status (weekly, monthly, etc.) will be
      determined by the last time you submitted, refresh status anytime by
      submitting newly completed levels (in order)
    </p>
